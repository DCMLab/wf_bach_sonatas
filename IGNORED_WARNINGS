DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 11, '3/8', 'V43') ms3.Parse.wf_bach_sonatas.F003_n04a
	The label V43 in m.10 is fine, the ornaments are passing tones

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 40, '3/8', 'V') ms3.Parse.wf_bach_sonatas.F003_n04a
	The label V in m.38 last beat is plausible, perhaps even V7 could be possible as well.
